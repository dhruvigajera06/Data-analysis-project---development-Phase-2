# Data-analysis-project---development-Phase-2
In the Development Phase, I implemented the NLP pipeline using Python. I preprocessed the data with Regex and NLTK, then compared CountVectorizer and TF-IDF. Using LDA and NMF, I identified topics like app stability and feature complaints. My analysis showed that technical bugs and UI changes are the main drivers of negative user sentiment.
